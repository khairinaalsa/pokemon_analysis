I'm using Pokemon dataset from Dibimbing.id on this link : https://bit.ly/data-pokemon-dsf. This dataset contains information about 800 Pokemon from six Pokemon Generations, including their types and various statistics. Aside from fulfilling the tasks of the Digital Skill Fair â€“ Data Science organized by Dibimbing, this data is highly intriguing for further analysis and exploration.

### Goals
1. What is the count of Pokemon per Generation?
2. What is the count of Pokemon per Type?
3. What is the comparison between Legendary and non-Legendary Pokemon?
4. Which Pokemon type is the strongest?
5. What is the correlation between each attribute?
6. Classifying Pokemon, whether they are Legendary or not?

### Insights
1. There are six generations in Pokemon. The first Pokemon generation has the highest number and the fewest Pokemon is the sixth generation. 
2. The most common type of Pokemon is the Water type.
3. The Pokemon named Rayquaza Mega Rayquaza, Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo X have the highest total.
4. The attributes Total and Sp. Atk have the strongest correlation, which is 0.75.
5. The column "Legendary" has two outputs, namely True and False. The number of False values is significantly larger than the True values.
6. The accuracy score of the KNN algorithm is 0.95 with a k value of 1.
