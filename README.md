I'm using Pokemon dataset from Dibimbing.id on this link : https://bit.ly/data-pokemon-dsf. This dataset contains information about 800 Pokemon from six Pokemon Generations, including their types and various statistics. Aside from fulfilling the tasks of the Digital Skill Fair â€“ Data Science organized by Dibimbing, this data is highly intriguing for further analysis and exploration.

### Goals
1. What is the count of Pokemon per Generation?
2. What is the count of Pokemon per Type?
3. What is the comparison between Legendary and non-Legendary Pokemon?
4. Which Pokemon type is the strongest?
5. What is the correlation between each attribute?
6. Classifying Pokemon, whether they are Legendary or not?
